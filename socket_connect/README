Connect Jetson TK1 and Linux PC using RJ45 cable (Assuming PC to be ixxat CAN to ethernet)

1. Set ethernet IP address for both Jetson and PC 

For Jetson:
sudo ip ad add 10.0.0.20/24 dev eth0

For PC:
sudo ip ad add 10.0.0.10/24 dev eno1

2. Check the assigned IP address by using "ifconfig" command in command prompt

We can also ensure by using the command ==> nmap -p 80 10.0.0.20 (IP address of other device)
which returns the following in case everything is successfully connected

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-24 11:54 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.20
Host is up (0.00064s latency).

PORT   STATE  SERVICE
80/tcp closed http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.04 seconds

3. Run socket_server.py in Jetson and socket_client.py in the LINUX PC

The output of the established connection is attached as "screenshots_of_PC & Jetson"

IN the Jetson: Connected by ('10.0.0.10',37240)
IN the PC: Received b'Hello , world'

NOTE: 10.0.0.20 is the IP address of Jetson and 10.0.0.10 is the IP address of PC
