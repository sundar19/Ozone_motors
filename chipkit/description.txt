The program (TCPEchoClient) of the controller (chipkit network shield) works as follows

#include <IM8720PHY.h> ==> library utilized for the ethernet 

#include <DEIPcK.h> ( the Digilent Embedded IP Stack) ==> library utilized for the digilent boards by chipkit for ethernet TCP and UDP

We can specify the IP of the server and the port to bind 

const char * szIPServer = "192.168.1.180"; 
unsigned short portServer = 44300;

The program consists of 5 stages being stated as swtich case.

1. CONNECT:
The first step connects the client to the server via deIPcK.tcpConnect(szIPServer, portServer, tcpClient, &status) 
This ensures the connection is estabalished with server IP address and port. The next step is to write data to the server.

2.WRITE:
This step mainly writes the values to the server using the function tcpClient.writeStream(rgbWriteStream, cbWriteStream); Where rgbwritestream is the data we want to write in the server and cbwritestream is the sizeof the data. The next step skips to read.

3.READ:
This state has a conditional operator. This conditional operator checks for the sizeof the data to be read. If the size is within range it proceeds to store the received value in a variable and display it. If not it replaces the size with a bigger size and proceeds to store it in a variable and display it.

4.CLOSE:
This state closes the TCP connection tcpClient.close();

5.DONE:
This state ends the switch case.
