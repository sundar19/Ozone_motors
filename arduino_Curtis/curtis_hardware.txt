The curtis hardware consists of two microprocessors 
 1. THe first is for the AC motor control and for processing the vehicle control language (VCL)
 2. The second processor for monitoring purposes such as timing and operation
 
 This AC motor controller works using vehicle control language or VCL
 
 HIGH POWER CONNECTIONS:
 1. B+ ==> Battery positive to controller
 2. B- ==> Battery negative to controller
 3. U
 4. V
 5. W
 
 Where 3,4,5 are the 3 phases of AC current
 
 LOW POWER CONNECTION:
 The low power connection consists of 35-pin AMPSEAL connector its specifications include

• Digital Inputs
• Digital and PWM Outputs
• Analog Inputs
• Analog Output
• Power Supply Outputs
• KSI and Coil Return Inputs
• Throttle and Brake Inputs
• Communications Ports I/O
• Position Feedback Inputs

KSI & coil return:
Provides power for all low power control circuits

Throttle & break i/ps:
Used to control throttle (power delivered to the AC motor)

Position feedback i/ps:(Quadrature Encoder)
Returns the position of the motor ( In the angle which the motor lies) as a square wave in quadrature form


Position feedback i/ps:(Sin/Cos sensor):
Returns the position of the motor in a sine or a cosine waveform 

The communication ports consists of CAN,UART etc.,
