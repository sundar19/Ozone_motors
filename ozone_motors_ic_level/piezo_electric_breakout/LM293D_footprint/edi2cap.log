   ADVICE: If you DON'T LIKE the result:
    Do another orcadwrite run using one of the following sets of OrCAD writer options:
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.05000 inch(s), 'Grid'=5000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.02500 inch(s), 'Grid'=2500 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.02000 inch(s), 'Grid'=2000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.01250 inch(s), 'Grid'=1250 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
