1. Connections
NOTE:
First cut the track of the MCP2515 module to give the TJA1050 transceiver 5V seperately through a capacitor(3rd pin of the chip) and 
3.3V to the Vcc of the module from the Raspberry Pi (MCP2515 CAN controller) 

RPi to CAN module
3.3V (Physical Pin 1) <==> Vcc CAN module
5V (Physical Pin 2) <==> soldered capacitor behind CAN module
GND (Physical Pin 6) <==> GND CAN module
CE0 (Physical Pin 24) <==> CS CAN module
MISO (Physical Pin 21) <==> SO CAN module
MOSI (Physical Pin 19) <==> SI CAN module
SCLK (Physical Pin 23) <==> SCK CAN module
GPIO-BCM-12 (Physical Pin 32) <==> INT CAN module

UNO to CAN module 
5V <==> Vcc
GND <==> GND
Pin 13 <==> SCK
Pin 12 <==> SO
Pin 11 <==> SI
Pin 10 <==> CS
